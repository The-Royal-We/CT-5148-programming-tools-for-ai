Notes:
- Some quantities were unclear in the source and marked as such. I preserved explicit amounts where they appeared.
- If you'd like this split into a shopping-size list (e.g., grouped by supermarket aisle) or have quantities normalized to specific servings, tell me how many people/days and I'll regenerate the amounts.
